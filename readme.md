===============

Forked from https://github.com/nagash/node-lol-client, credits for his work on most of the base code, and especially the AMF RTMP library, crucial for communication with Riot's servers.

This fork aims to fix the bugs left behind in the original project, and expand the features for developmental purposes.

Right now, it doesn't seem like some queries are working. You're much better off using the official Riot API instead of using the RTMP api. ):

I am getting close to getting it to work after a full refactor from Coffeescript to JS.
